# Devo Node.js Sender

The Node.js Sender is included in the
[Devo SDK](../README.md).
It can be used to send events to Devo
and upload whole files.

## Quick Start

Install with `npm`:

    $ npm install @devo/nodejs-sdk

Send some data to Devo in your code:

``` js
const devo = require('@devo/nodejs-sdk')

const sender = devo.sender({host, port})
sender.send('my first message')
```

From that point you can start sending events, either as strings or as objects:

```js
sender.send('something happened')
sender.send({message: 'something happened', priority: 'high'})
```

See detailed info on
[sender credentials](#sender-credentials),
[sending events](#sending-events)
and [command line uploads](#command-line-uploads).

## Sender Credentials

You need to be a customer to send events to Devo.
You can obtain your certificate and private key from
[Devo](https://www.devo.com/):
go to the "Administration/Credentials" section,
and then to
["X.509 Certificates"](https://docs.devo.com/confluence/docs/administration/administration-credentials#Administrationcredentials-X.509Certificates).

![X.509 Certificates](img/download-certificate.png)

From there you will need to download Certificate (to use as `cert`)
and Private Key (as `key`) for your account.
Also you will need to download the Chain CA
to use it as `ca`.

## Sending Events

The SDK supports sending events to Devo.
First import the SDK in your code and start the sender:

``` js
const devo = require('@devo/nodejs-sdk')

const sender = devo.sender(options)
```

From there you can start sending events, either as strings or as objects:

```js
sender.send('something happened')
sender.send({message: 'something happened', priority: 'high'})
```

Devo only ingests plain text messages;
if an object is passed it will be converted to JSON before sending it.

### Sender Options

These options are passed to the `devo.sender()` constructor.
They will determine where and how to send the events.

#### `host`

Host to send the events.
Optional, default value `localhost`.
Can be looked up in Devo as
[relay
address](https://docs.devo.com/confluence/docs/system-configuration/relays),
as (host:port).

#### `port`

Port to send the events.
Mandatory.
Can be looked up in Devo as
[relay
address](https://docs.devo.com/confluence/docs/system-configuration/relays),
as (host:port).

#### `cert`

Certificate for sending events securely.
Optional; if not present will send events as cleartext (not recommended).
You need to pass the whole certificate, not a path.
Can be downloaded from Devo as
[sender credentials](#sender-credentials).

#### `key`

Private key for sending events securely.
Optional; must be present if `cert` is used.
You need to pass the whole key, not a path.
Can be downloaded from Devo as
[sender credentials](#sender-credentials).

#### `ca`

Certificate of the authority that created `cert` for sending events securely.
Optional; needed only if the `cert` is not signed by a recognized CA.
You need to pass the whole certificate, not a path.
Can be downloaded from Devo as
[sender credentials](#sender-credentials)
(button "Client CA").

#### `objectMode`

If the sender is going to be used as a stream and you want to
send objects, set to `true`. Objects will be converted to JSON.
Optional, default `false`.
See [send to stream](#send-to-stream) for details.

#### `rfc5424`

If truthy, will send messages using
[RFC 5424](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424)
instead of the more lax
[RFC 3164](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3164).

Examples:

* Default (RFC 3164):
`<13>2019-02-15T09:10:53.975Z localhost siem.logtrust.batrasio.free: Message`
* RFC 5424:
`<13>1 2019-02-15T09:10:53.975Z localhost siem.logtrust.batrasio.free 1511 master - Message

#### `priority`

Priority value as specified by
[RFC 5424](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424#section-6.2.1).
Optional, default value `13`.

#### `tag`

Tag to use for the events.
The tag will determine the table to store the events on Devo.
Optional, default value `my.app`.

#### `localhost`

Name of the host that generates the events.
Optional, default value `localhost.localdomain`.

#### `pid`

Process ID. Default value: `process.pid`. Only used in RFC 5424.

#### `worker`

Worker ID. Default value `master`. Only used in RFC 5424.

#### `debug`

Show messages on console before sending them. Useful for debug.

### Putting It All Together

To create the sender you will need to pass all the parameters required.
Example:

```js
const sender = devo.sender({
  host: 'app.logtrust.com',
  port: 443,
  cert: fs.readFileSync('path/to/cert'),
  key: fs.readFileSync('path/to/key'),
  ca: fs.readFileSync('path/to/ca'),
  tag: 'my.app',
})
```

### Send to Stream

The `sender` returned can be used as a writeable Node.js stream:
it can be written to, piped to and so on.
The stream also implements backpressure:
if too much data is sent at a time it will throttle the writer back.

For example, to send a file to Devo line by line:

```js
const devo = require('@devo/nodejs-sdk')
const fs = require('fs')

const sender = devo.sender(options)
const rs = fs.createReadStream('/path/to/file')
rs.pipe(sender)
```

It can also be used to send objects, which will be converted to JSON
before sending.
In this case the option `objectMode` must be set to `true`:

```js
const sender = devo.sender({
  objectMode: true,
  ...
})
sender.write({key: 'value'})
sender.end()
```

## Command Line Uploads

To send files to Devo from the command line please install the package globally:

```
npm install -g @devo/nodejs-sdk
```

Then you can use the installed command `devo-send`:

```
devo-send \
  --host eu.elb.relay.logtrust.net \
  --port 443 \
  --cert path/to/cert \
  --key path/to/key \
  --ca path/to/ca \
  --file path/to/file/to/upload
```

You must download your certificate and key from Devo;
see [sender credentials](#sender-credentials) for more details.

To see all the params please use --help.

```
devo-send --help
```
