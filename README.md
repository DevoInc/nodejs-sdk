# Devo Node.js SDK

This is the SDK to access Devo directly from Node.js.
It can be used to send events and files to Devo,
to make queries and to manage deferred tasks.

## Quick Start

Install with `npm`:

    $ npm install @devo/nodejs-sdk

Send some data to Devo in your code:

``` js
const devo = require('@devo/nodejs-sdk')

const sender = devo.sender({host, port})
sender.send('my first message')
```

You can send as many events as desired, either as strings or objects:

```js
sender.send('something happened')
sender.send({message: 'something happened', priority: 'high'})
```

Now you can send a query to Devo in your code:

``` js
const devo = require('@devo/nodejs-sdk')

const client = devo.client({url, apiKey, apiSecret})
client.query({
  query: 'from demo.ecommerce.data select eventdate,protocol,statusCode,method',
}, (error, result) => {
  console.log('Received %j', result)
})
```

## Installation

You will need to have Node.js locally installed, version 8 or later.
Install the SDK with:

    $ npm install @devo/nodejs-sdk

Or include it in your package.json dependencies and run `npm install`.

## Sender

See [sender documentation](https://github.com/DevoInc/nodejs-sdk/blob/master/docs/sender.md).

## Devo Client

See [client documentation](https://github.com/DevoInc/nodejs-sdk/blob/master/docs/client.md).

## Development

Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/devoinc/nodejs-sdk
```

Install all dependencies:

```
cd nodejs-sdk
npm install
```

Make sure that everything runs fine:

```
npm test
```
